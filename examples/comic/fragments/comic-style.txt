Illustrated in the artistic style of 1960s pop-art.

Pay close attention to the following aspects when compositing and editing images together:
1. Object scale: Object scale should look photorealistic, even if the illustration style is not.
2. Collision detection and object placement. If rendering a character with his feet on a desk, the feet should not be on top of another object on the desk like a typewriter or a mug.
